# 10Wave

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) based game created in 24 hours for [Hack Club Counterspell](https://counterspell.hackclub.com/). Created with the help of 3 other team members, whose GitHub accounts I don't know. :)

# Running the game

Download the latest release from the Releases tab. **Execute the JAR by typing java -jar \<jar path>**

# Objective

Clear 10 waves of enemies as fast as you can. Try to beat my record of 40 seconds. Careful, though; every bullet you shoot will bounce against the walls, creating a chance of shooting yourself with your own bullets. 

# Controls

Shoot with ←, →, and ↑. Move with A, D, and W.
